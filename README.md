# AsciiDoc Alive

AsciiDoc Alive is a live AsciiDoc editor with real-time preview, syntax highlighting, and export functionality.

> Why? Because I wanted a simple, clean, and fast AsciiDoc editor since asciidoclive.com is not working anymore.

## Features

- Real-time preview
- Syntax highlighting with CodeMirror
- Line numbers
- Dark theme
- Export functionality (PDF and AsciiDoc)
- Clean interface
