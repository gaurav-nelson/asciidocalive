# AsciiDoc Alive

[AsciiDoc Alive](https://asciidocalive.docswriter.com/) is a live AsciiDoc editor with real-time preview, syntax highlighting, and export functionality.

> Why? Because I wanted a simple, clean, and fast AsciiDoc editor since asciidoclive.com is not working right now.

## Features

- **Editing Experience**: Real-time preview, syntax highlighting, line numbering, and dark mode.
- **File Handling**: Import local files and GitHub and GitLab URLs; export to HTML, PDF, and AsciiDoc.
- **Diagrams**: Render diagrams using [Kroki.io](https://kroki.io) supporting PlantUML, Mermaid, GraphViz, Ditaa, and many more diagram types.
- **Performance & Privacy**:
